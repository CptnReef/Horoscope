## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Hello everybody! <b>'Astrology Channel'</b> or <b>'Horoscope Channel'</b>, is a Horoscope project using React. Users will be able to sign up for their daily horoscope news and more. Astrology news is used for Social Fun Events that  is user oriented.

## 🎥 Demo / Working <a name = "demo"></a>

![Working](https://media2.giphy.com/media/WmtnVfTNbDigG32A8u/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47ha3jz1pgrbcmyo8wow90kg9l1ydhh3i517orf0br&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)

## 💭 How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The bot first extracts user data from the retrieved data and then fetches user's astrology sign, send, example and source from the Astrology API.

If somehow there is missing data in the Horoscope Channel, then returns a 404 response upon which the bot then tries to fetch results form the Astrology API.

The entire bot is written in Python 3.8.2

## 🎈 Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use this bot, enter in your DOB:

```
01/01/2000
```

The first part, i.e. "!dict" **is not** case sensitive.

The bot will then give you the Oxford Dictionary (or Urban Dictionary; if the word does not exist in the Oxford Dictionary) definition of the word as a comment reply.
